# Theme

- Add --dev-preview flag for shopify theme language-server. This flag will run the language-server that uses the new typescript implementation of theme-check.

- Fix ambiguity between --editor and --environment flags in the shopify theme open command
- Enhance the shopify theme dev command banner by adding the preview URL next to the preview link, for easy copy/pasting in terminal emulators that support hyperlinks
- The shopify theme delete command no longer fails when some flags (-f, -d, etc.) are passed without the -t flag
