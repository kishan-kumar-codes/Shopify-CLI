# App

- You can now subscribe to webhook topics using the app configuration file (`shopify.app.toml`). To get started, use the [new tutorial for Shopify webhook subscriptions](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/webhooks/subscribe/get-started).
- Log streaming for Shopify Functions within `app dev` and re-execution of function runs via `app function replay` are available in beta. See [Shopify Functions documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/functions/log-streaming-and-replay) for more information. https://github.com/Shopify/cli/commit/7742994a5616e685e1cd52b5297d684fcf5f481a
