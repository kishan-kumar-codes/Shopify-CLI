now be updated with the correct app and store when `app dev` is restarted.
* ***[Fix: Attempt auth refresh when updating extension drafts.](https://github.com/Shopify/cli/pull/3233)*** Rather than
failing to update extensions, the CLI will refresh authentication and reattempt.
* ***[Fix: Postinstall step for Cloudflare.](https://github.com/Shopify/cli/pull/3288)*** When `cloudflared` is
installed but doesn't work, an attempt will be made to reinstall.

# Theme
* ***[New Theme Command: `shopify theme rename`.](https://github.com/Shopify/cli/pull/3242)*** The command renames an
existing theme.
* ***[Fix: Password page error for Safari.](https://github.com/Shopify/cli/pull/3249)*** Previously, opening a locally
hosted theme in Safari and entering the password, the page would redirect back to the password entry page. Now, the
redirect works properly, and the user can enter the store.
