# App
- ***Versioned app configuration***:
  - The [deploy](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/tools/cli/commands#deploy) command now includes the app configuration.
  - The `config push` command is dropped out.
  - Added the new `include_config_on_deploy` [flag](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/tools/cli/configuration#build) inside the `toml` to enable the inclusion or not of the app configuration.
  - Now [Direct API Access](https://shopify-dev-staging2.shopifycloud.com/docs/api/app-bridge-library#direct-api-access) can be configured as part of the [App configuration](https://shopify-dev-staging2.shopifycloud.com/docs/apps/tools/cli/configuration#admin).

# Theme
- ***[Theme Check 2.0](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/tools/theme-check)***. It marks the grand unification of Shopify theme developer tools. Now, you can use all Language Server Protocol (LSP) features in the [admin code editor](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/tools/code-editor), on the [Shopify Liquid VS Code extension](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/tools/theme-check/vscode), and on [Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/tools/cli). It includes:
  - Hover documentation support
  - Code completion for theme, section, and block settings
  - Code completion for theme translations
  - Code completion for HTML tags, attributes, and values
  - Code completion for Liquid filters, objects, and tags
  - Enhanced auto-closing pair user experience
  - Automatic support for new Liquid tags, filters, and objects

- ***Fix: Use the legacy `shopify theme pull` implementation by default*** and bring the new one behind the `--beta` flag.
