# App

* ***New `roles` field for `shopify.web.toml`.*** Unify web processes, having more of the same environment variables in all cases. Multiple `roles` can now be passed instead of a single `type`. Also, `background` webs are allowed with neither frontend nor backend properties.
* ***Allow Theme App Extensions to exclude files from deploying via `.shopifyignore` file***.
* ***Show extensions as disabled during generation when they have reached their limit***.
* ***Rename `api-key` flag to `client-id`***. The old flag will continue to work for now, but it will show a warning message.
* ***Update `app generate schema` output***: either to `schema.graphql` (by default) or stdout with `--stdout` flag.
* ***Fix: Display `dev` command footer when using `no-update` or/and `no-tunnel`***.
* ***Fix: Skip .DS_Store files when the Theme App Extension bundle content is created***.
* ***Fix: App loader error message when not specification is found***.
* ***Fix: APP_UNINSTALLED webhook triggered on app reset***. That way, it also works for frontend-only apps.
* ***Fix: Improve React conflicts management***. Add React deduplication plugin for ESBuild & extensions.
* ***Fix: hot-reload for Theme App Extensions when blocks are rendered on section groups***.

# Theme
* ***Introduce the `--open` flag to open a browser window only when users specifically request it***.
* ***Fix: `shopify theme dev` command to show valid URLs when `--theme` flag is used with a theme name***.
* ***Fix: Issues on `theme dev` affecting asset and image loading on local servers***.
* ***Fix: Remove image proxying through local server to enable proper functioning of Liquid filters***.
* ***Fix: `theme dev` re-authentication***. The process will now silently refresh credentials without restarting the server.
