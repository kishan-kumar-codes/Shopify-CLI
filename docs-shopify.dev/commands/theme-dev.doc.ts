  Uploads the current theme as the specified theme, or a [development theme](/docs/themes/tools/cli#development-themes), to a store so you can preview it.

This command returns the following information:

- A link to your development theme at http://127.0.0.1:9292. This URL can hot reload local changes to CSS and sections, or refresh the entire page when a file changes, enabling you to preview changes in real time using the store's data.

  You can specify a different network interface and port using \`--host\` and \`--port\`.

- A link to the [editor](/docs/themes/tools/online-editor) for the theme in the Shopify admin.

- A [preview link](https://help.shopify.com/manual/online-store/themes/adding-themes#share-a-theme-preview-with-others) that you can share with other developers.

If you already have a development theme for your current environment, then this command replaces the development theme with your local theme. You can override this using the \`--theme-editor-sync\` flag.

> Note: You can't preview checkout customizations using http://127.0.0.1:9292.

Development themes are deleted when you run \`shopify auth logout\`. If you need a preview link that can be used after you log out, then you should [share](/docs/api/shopify-cli/theme/theme-share) your theme or [push](/docs/api/shopify-cli/theme/theme-push) to an unpublished theme on your store.

You can run this command only in a directory that matches the [default Shopify theme folder structure](/docs/themes/tools/cli#directory-structure).`,
